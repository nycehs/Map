# Map
This repository is for testing simple data maps using vega-lite. 
View a sample: https://nycehs.github.io/Map/main/main.html

It includes a  view of counts that avoids some of the issues showing counts in a choropleth (thanks for the inspiration NYTimes and a million geographers).

Thanks to Gretchen Culp for the Modified ZCTA shapefile, soon to be available on NYC Open Data.

Many thanks to the team behind the fantastic Open-Source project Vega.js and Vega-Lite: https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/
